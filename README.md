RISC-V Simulator ðŸš€

A lightweight and efficient RISC-V ISA simulator designed for executing and analyzing RISC-V assembly instructions. This project enables users to simulate RISC-V programs, inspect register/memory states, and debug execution flow in a user-friendly interface.

Features:
âœ… Supports a subset of RISC-V instructions (RV32I, RV64I, etc.)
âœ… Step-by-step execution with detailed state visualization
âœ… Memory and register inspection for debugging
âœ… Customizable pipeline simulation (if applicable)
âœ… Written in Python

ðŸš€ Get Started
Clone the repository and run the simulator:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/riscv-simulator.git  
cd riscv-simulator  
python main.py 
ðŸ“Œ To-Do
Add support for floating-point instructions (RV32F/RV64F)
Implement cache and pipeline simulation
Optimize performance for large-scale execution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
